## Variants

In the spirit of Adrien Perez's legendary easter egg in the original H3 loading screen (happy birthday, Lauren!), this remaster has a few fun variants. Each can be accessed by appending one of the following flags to the URL. For example: `xephorium.github.io/Halo3LoadingScreen?virgil`

| Screen Variants |

The following flags can also be included with any variant to scale resolution or disable individual draw calls. For example: `xephorium.github.io/Halo3LoadingScreen?virgil&2k&nologo`
